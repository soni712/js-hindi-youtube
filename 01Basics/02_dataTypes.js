//ECMAScript - when you use newer version of js you use "use strict"
"use strict" //Treat all js code as newer version
// There are two types of Datatypes : -
// 1. Primitive
//number => 2 to the power 53
//bigint
//string =>''
//boolean => true or false
// null => Stand Alone value (Represenatation of emmpty value);u  intentionally telling it is empty;
// undefined => value is not assigned yet
//symbol => Use for uniqueness

// 2. Non -primitive
// Object

//interview question we define tyoe of data by typeOf and typeof null is object and undefined is undefined.
